# Recording Guide

Step-by-Step process of generating audio documents, from selection of aprrporiate academic articles to processing of audio files ready for implementation into the website

## Step 1. Picking a Paper

Firstly, a journal should be selected that is within or adjascent to the field of expertise of the proposed speakers for recording. Within these journals, those that do not provide open access should be filtered out of the selection pool. From here, personal preference can determine article selection. For intial development, articles with fewer than 10 pages are advised. 

## Step 2. Recording

Recording is conducted with the [software] program. To allow for easy integration with the web-platform, articles should be recorded in three separate pieces.

### Title & Overview

In this section, the title of the article, authors of the article, date of publication should be recorded. Here the speaker should introduce themselves alongside sny information relevant to their qualifications on the topic. 

### Abstract

The abstracted should be recorded in full as a separate audio file to allow for users to simply glean whether they wish to interact with the full paper. Separate recording will allow for this to be provided suring the article selection pages.

### Main Body

The main body of the text is to be recorded in full. Citations are to be ignored, but parenthetical information included where relevant. Pauses  of approximately 3 seconds after each paragrpah should be included for easier processing of timestamps. 


## Step 3. Annotating



## Step 4. Extracting Figures/Tables/etc.

Figures/Tables should be extracted by using the snipping tool to screen capture the figure and it's caption. Each figure should be saved as a separate JPEG file to be uploaded to the webpage
